# HandSpeak
â€œA Machine Learning Solution for Seamless  Communication with the Deaf and the Mute"
This project aims to develop a machine learning model integrated into 
an application that can recognize and translate hand signs into text to assist 
deaf people in communicating more easily. The ML model will use computer 
vision techniques to capture and interpret images of hand signs made by the 
user, and then apply machine learning algorithms to convert them into text. 
The system is designed to be user-friendly, accurate, and accessible to a wide 
range of users. The project will involve developing and training the machine 
learning model on a large dataset of hand sign images, optimizing its 
performance, and integrating it with a user-friendly interface that is accessible 
and intuitive for deaf individuals.
